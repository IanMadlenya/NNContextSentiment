# NNContextSentiment

This is the code of AAAI 2016 papers:  
Yafeng Ren, Yue Zhang, Meishan Zhang, Donghong Ji. [Improving Twitter Sentiment Classification Using Topic-Enriched Multi-Prototype Word Embeddings](http://zhangmeishan.github.io/Ren_11925.pdf). In Proceedings of the AAAI 2016. 2016.02.  
Yafeng Ren, Yue Zhang, Meishan Zhang, Donghong Ji. [Context-Sensitive Twitter Sentiment Classification Using Neural Network](http://zhangmeishan.github.io/Ren.pdf). In Proceedings of the AAAI 2016. 2016.02. 

Some issues:  
1. For the first paper, please neglect the contextual features;  
2. For the second paper, you would better refer to [another implementation by Da Pan](https://github.com/pdjlzs/NNContextSentiment), a student of mine. This version does not include the character embeddings.

I'll give more readable implementations soon.  
Any questions, please email to [meishan zhang](mason.zms@gmail.com)
